From [Audiophile On](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/meze-99-classics-review-headphone):

* The excellent
    * "The midrange is highly impressive and certainly the star of the show. Vocals sound incredible in these headphones and oh so natural. ... Detail throughout the mids sounds excellent and instrument or voice feels clearly spaced and uncluttered."
    * "Imaging is excellent.  Artists sound slightly infront of you and they display medium width and depth of equal scale which is excellent for a closed back headphone."

* The good
    * "The low end is not what I would call technically perfect but in the context of the overall tuning it works very well to round off the 99 Classics sound.  You get bass that extend fairly deep but not into bass heavy territory. It is encapsulating in granduer but doesnt boom. This is the kind of headphone where you don't want a visceral, sharp bass but a smoother on that compliments the slightly warm tones of the midrange."

From [Inner Fidelity](https://web.archive.org/web/20191029192946/https://www.innerfidelity.com/content/meze-99-classics-very-fun-very-tasty-page-2):

* The excellent
    * "The midrange on the 99 Classics is superb. Very coherent and even throughout; voices are rendered with wonderfully balanced tone; performers are neither too distant or in your face. This is a marvelously organic and musical headphone."
    * "The Meze 99 Classic is a ridiculously fun listen. In my reading I think it was said best by grizzlybeast in his Head-Fi review, "Everything pops, snaps, flickers, clicks, and sings on these set of cans." I have a very hard time thinking of a headphone I've had more fun listening to; the urge to bop my head and tap my toes was irresistible at time. Every track and every genre I tried left me feeling only one thing, "Very, very fun!""

* The good
    * "Bass response sounds slightly over-emphatic—I think the level is just about right, but modestly loose and mildly distorted response does bring it a bit more attention to it. Extension is good, but does not quite fully reach into the lowest octave. Even though this is the 99 Classics weakest area, the bass still seemed to integrate and add pleasure to the overall listening experience."

## Supplementary

**Thinksound On2** (discontinued)

From [Prime Audio](https://primeaudio.org/thinksound-on2-review/):

* The excellent
    * "The bass is punchy, fast yet still has a natural sounding decay and a real texture."
    * ""Kick drums and bass notes have a well-defined edge that resonates beautifully in the wooden ear-cups."
    * "Simply put the On2 has one of the best-tuned basses I’ve heard in the sub $200 category. There’s enough drive to bring EDM and hip-hop to life and it’s conservative enough to not become overbearing in rock and acoustic music."
    * "There’s great instrument separation and spacing within sounds and the small details that sneak into the music continue to surprise me."

* The good
    * "Soundstage is neither particularly wide or narrow but there’s a good perception of space in all directions and imaging and positioning are precise."

## Convenience picks

**Airpods Pro**

They are what they are.

## Making the TV sound less like a tin can

**Klipsch R-10B soundbar**

"If there’s one adjective that can be aptly applied ..., it's: spartan. It’s not big on extras and features, and instead seems to be engineered to do one thing really well – produce head-turning sound." ([Audioholics](https://www.audioholics.com/soundbar-and-satellite-speaker-reviews/klipsch-r-10b-soundbar-review))

## Turntable

**Pro-ject Debut Carbon Evo**

For greater detail, less "excitement" than similarly priced competition.

## Speakers

**Andover Spinbase**

Haters gonna hate, but it's amazing for what it is. Surpasses expectations in every way, while adding only to the vertical space of a tiny apartment setup.

Reviews I liked:

* [Tech Hive](https://www.techhive.com/article/3533969/andover-audio-spinbase-review.html)
    * "It’s an ingenious, all-in-one, plug-n-play speaker system designed specifically for turntables. It’s a near perfect solution for apartment dwellers or rooms that can’t accommodate larger systems. The Spinbase’s simplicity, performance, and sheer bang for the buck left me awe-struck."
    * "Andover Audio says the Spinbase’s driver arrangement produces an expansive 270-degree stereo image. I’m typically skeptical of marketing claims, but short of pulling out my protractor, I was simply awe-struck by the breadth of the Spinbase’s soundstage. Unlike a typical two-channel speaker setup that gives you a single sweet spot, I could walk from one side of the Spinbase and around to the other with virtually no audible off-axis penalty. The speaker’s sound was smooth and consistent from one side to the other."

* [Sound & Vision](https://www.soundandvision.com/content/andover-spinbase-turntable-speaker-system-review)
    * "The first thing I noticed when firing up the Spinbase was just how open and free from boxiness its sonic image was. I'm not sure what DSP tricks are being used, but the image was expansive without sounding unfocused or out-of-phase. ... the bass I heard was tight and clear."
    * "With record after record, I found the Spinbase to be a great way to enjoy music without getting preoccupied with audiophile minutiae."
