Meditation for computer scientists

0\. Just to mention

"Meditation" is a broad term and means many things to many people. I use it here because it is the most fitting to these topics, not because these topics are the most fitting to it.

By "computer scientists" I mean anyone who feels at home in the intersecting fields, including mathematics, the physical sciences, and various engineering disciplines.

I expect this will make little sense to the vast majority of people, but for the very few who find it useful, it may be extremely so.

1\. Setting the stage

When you're in a bad emotional state, it's easy to forget what being in a good emotional state ever felt like. It can seem impossible that you were once happy, or that happiness even exists.

In such a negative state, any positive state feels like it must be "false", somehow—after all, the world is still the same, only your own perceptions and attitudes have changed. It seems natural to conclude that good emotions are simply your brain "fooling itself"—that the bad emotional state actually has it "right".

Furthermore, in the good emotional state, you stop thinking about these issues of good and bad emotions altogether. Self awareness of emotional state is nearly nonexistent when happy; yet more evidence, when back in the negative state, that the good emotional state is naive and less trustworthy.

So then, how could the "good" emotional state actually be good? If the "bad" emotional state is more correct, or closer to reality in a way, then shouldn't the bad one be the good one, and the good one bad?

One way to avoid the "good" and "bad" language is to conceptualize these states as buckets. The near bucket is the one in which we think about buckets (hence, it is near). The far bucket is the one in which all notion of buckets flees the mind (and so, when talking and thinking about buckets, this one is always far). Theoretically the spectrum of buckets between near and far is continuous, not discrete, so we needn't define "how many" buckets are between near and far; there is only distance in one dimension.

This bucket language helps to think of the conundrum without connotation. And yet, we intuitively think of and call the emotional states "good" and "bad" in the way we do, and when in the near (bad) state, we yearn to be in the far (good) state. This indicates something in this conflict needs to be, and can be, reconciled.

2\. A slight perspective shift

Consider that emotions happen in the context of an intellect. One can feel a full spectrum of emotions—from happiness to sadness, anger, despair, resentment, and so on—yet these feelings are always happening against a backdrop of thoughts.

For the sake of teasing out the interactions between emotion and intellect, let us now consider them as agents. Emotion, on one hand, does its thing, mostly oblivious to intellect. Intellect, on the other hand, is aware and critical of emotion.

Now the "bucket" conundrum described earlier can be explained as intellect doubting emotion. Intellect judges emotion to be naive when happy, and more aligned to intellect when sad, and thus more grounded in reality. So when individuals live primarily aligned to intellect, they naturally doubt the good emotions more than the bad.

Notice too there is a feedback loop. Intellect judges emotion, dampening good emotions, and reinforcing bad emotions when they are present.

3\. A realization

We have established that emotion on one hand is judged by intellect on the other. Applying intellect to emotion can drive emotion more and more negative. But what happens when intellect is applied to itself?

When intellect recognizes that it doubts emotion, it then asks, "What doubts me?"

This meta-intellect that models emotion and intellect now doubts intellect. And if the emotion <-> intellect interaction can recurse one level to intellect <-> meta intellect, this suggests an n-level recursion. (We have a strange loop.)

This realization frees intellect: as oblivious as intellect judges emotions to be of it, intellect may itself be just as oblivious to something beyond it. Realizing that it can be fooled just as easily, intellect can take itself less seriously.

Notice there is another feedback loop. Living with the meta-intellect understanding humbles intellect and, in turn, allows emotions to be.

4\. A corollary

This understanding can be applied elsewhere.

Consider, broadly:

Concluding life is meaningless is trivial. Concluding that this somehow makes life meaningful is nonsensical. Concluding this meaninglessness is itself meaningless is what we have done here.

In a perfectly meaningless world, meaninglessness does not have to be distressing or made positive. It simply is.

For a reason similar to the phenomenon in the original bucket model, it is difficult to benefit from the conclusion stated alone. When we intuitively feel the conclusion, we do not need to hear it; when we have forgotten it, the conclusion itself seems trite, and cliches do not encourage clarity. Thus, we must convince our intellect of its own unimportance, and that requires the reasoning laid out in §1 through §3.

Incidentally, notice the bucket model is not necessarily false, only incomplete. We simply need to realize the next layer of buckets, and apply that realization recursively.

5\. Prior art and further consideration

> According to Buddhist theory, through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state (samadhi). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which is the quality of mind that can "clearly see" (vi-passana) the nature of phenomena. According to the Buddhist tradition, all phenomena are to be seen as impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty. When this happens, one develops dispassion (viraga) for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.

> The (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist Zhuangzi records zuowang or "sitting forgetting" meditation. Confucius asked his disciple Yan Hui to explain what "sit and forget" means: "I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare."

> "I did examine myself," he [Christopher Knight] said. "Solitude did increase my perception. But here’s the tricky thing—when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. With no audience, no one to perform for, I was just there. There was no need to define myself; I became irrelevant. The moon was the minute hand, the seasons the hour hand. I didn’t even have a name. I never felt lonely. To put it romantically: I was completely free."

Before attempting to practice meditation, it is prudent to study the literature (both ancient and recent), if only to recognize and reinforce the key milestones in your journey. It takes an immense amount of knowledge when starting in order to advance, but the further you go, the more you are able to forget.

Lastly, to quote from my own §0, a parting reminder:

> "Meditation" is a broad term and means many things to many people. I use it here because it is the most fitting to these topics, not because these topics are the most fitting to it.
