No one told me Les Demoiselles is huge. We spent three lectures, 75 minutes each, on Picasso, and no one ever mentioned the size of the canvas. What did we cover? It was scandalous (nudes are fine, but never depict prostitutes, of course), it caused a wave (upstaging Matisse, whose Fauvism suddenly seemed tamer in comparison), and it was a formative work (one of the earliest steps toward Cubism, the almighty, revered modern movement).

But not one word that it is huge! (It is nearly 8 ft x 8 ft, or about 2.4 m x 2.3 m for the non-Americans.) And yes—this matters. Looking at the recreations of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, one notices, mainly, the African masks and fragmentation of color and form throughout. When seen in a textbook, or even projected on a screen, the painting looks like poorly drawn figures with questionable color choices.

In person, though, the massive size of the canvas means that, even standing at a distance, the figures appear larger than life. Then, the mind superimposes Picasso's figures with an actual human posing in the same way. Suddenly, the deliberate choices of the artist become clear and interesting.

Take the elbows of the central figures as an example. Seen as a small work, they are terrible. Larger than life, with their shape—the sudden jagged ends, the one misplaced rounded protrusion—they are striking. They are unapologetic and mesmerizing for it. (A similar effect happens with the knees of the two leftmost figures.)

The coloring, too, is transformed. Dull, conflicting, and displeasing in smaller renditions, they are fascinating in person. Some areas of the painting have a translucent quality; in the center-left figure's torso, we see a grey foundation, with thinly applied paint on top. This translucency, added to the fragmented background—color blocking, broken by line and shadow—creates an effect almost like stained glass. Les Demoiselles looks almost like light, pouring off the wall, from a massive, larger than life canvas.

This is all lost when studying this work from paper or screens. I just keep repeating in disbelief: how did no one mention this is huge! I think of my professors and TAs and wonder; now that I have seen Les Demoiselles, the size of it is the first thing I mention. For a field that emphasizes fact and observation as the foundation for analysis and interpretation, this was an astonishing oversight.

Even if the mental and experiential characteristics I finally discovered are impossible to capture in photographs, surely we can at least be told of them, and what is missing from reality to recreation.
