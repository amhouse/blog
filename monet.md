# Monet, Impressionism, and of course, the Water Lilies

## Part 3 of the ["What art history professors never taught me"](https://amhouse.github.io/blog) series

I had always loved to hate the Water Lilies. As the most famous of Monet's works, on par with [Starry Night](https://amhouse.github.io/blog/van-gogh-village) in universal recognizability, they come up a fair amount in all walks of life. And I always would always delight in saying, "Monet's earlier works are much more interesting, and Manet is better than Monet, anyway." (Yes, I am sometimes that person.)

For the record, I still stand by that statement—or, at least, partially. I would not be here writing about the Water Lilies if I had not been pleasantly surprised by them. And no, it was not the size that surprised me; unlike [Les Demoiselles](https://amhouse.github.io/blog/larger-than-life), I did know that every work in the Water Lilies series is huge. (Typically each 2 to 7 ft, or 70 to 200 cm, in the smallest dimension.)

No, what surprised me is that, despite how terribly muddy they appear in photos, how repetitive they appear as a catalogue, and yes, how popular they are, they are actually good. Really good.

In general, I assume the audience of this blog has a solid foundation in art history or art appreciation. But, to illustrate both my previous stance on the Water Lilies and my recent turnaround, I will present an incomplete, non-comprehensive walkthrough of Impressionism through Monet's oeuvre.

We begin in 1872 with the archetypal Impression, Sunrise. This is the work that named the movement. Look and see that, unlike the art of many previous movements, Monet was not concerned about depicting exactly what was present in reality. Instead, he painted something closer to what the eye more truthfully sees. A central boat in the distant sunrise becomes a dark smudge; boats further back become blue in the mist. In the farthest background, they become all but lost in the fog. The rising sun, as the brightest point in the sky, cannot be directly looked at (at least in reality), so in the painting, it shines most beautifully when in the corner of the eye (and reflects brilliantly on the water). The water, too, is flickering and glimmering; it has the quality of being clear and reflective in some areas, or rippling and opaque in others. (Analyzing the sky is left as an exercise to the reader!)

Then, 4-5 years later, we go to Women in the Garden. This continues to showcase concepts crucial to Impressionism. Monet was fascinated by instantaneity and capturing the quality of movement, despite paintings being static images. You can see this preoccupation in the way the rightmost woman's dress ripples, or in the swaying of the grass in the bottom left corner. Light effects are also important to instantaneity (and I do not know why art historians favor this term so much; I just go along with using it). The Impressionists were obsessed with painting _en plein air_ (outdoors) in order to, among other reasons, faithfully capture light effects. See how the light flickers through foliage, evident in the uneven shadows in the bottom right, or how it dances on the women's dresses and parasols, light and shadow being treated as importantly as color and form.

Now for one of my favorite comparisons in history: La Grenouillère by Renoir and Monet, who painted the same scene, side by side in 1869. I love this comparison because it shows you how two artists can use the same techniques but execute so differently. They both use thick layers of paint; choppy, broken lines of brushstrokes for the water; a big mess of green colors for the background; and generally, a level of abstraction away from a faithful rendition of reality, as mentioned previously. But see the difference—Monet's mess of green actually looks like a line of trees on a beach, with a distinct blue sky further in the distance. His water, by god, actually looks like beautiful, reflective, rippling water; somehow, he captured the right curves and divots that rippling water appears to have. In Renoir's, I can look for those elements and see that he intended for them to be there, but with Monet's, my brain automatically registers them as such.

To round this up, skipping to 1877, we have the Gare Saint-Lazare. I love the version currently in London's National Gallery in particular. See the balance of glass, light, and steam, all atmospheric and clear, but masterfully rendered with distinct characteristics. Lastly, personal experience biases me toward mentioning the Boulevard des Capucines. It now lives in Kansas City's Nelson-Atkins Museum. In 1873, Monet painted this in a friend's studio, a few stories high, overlooking a boulevard. I can tell you from experience that, as you walk by this painting, you do a double take, thinking you have actually looked out a window onto a snowy street. (This photo does not do it justice. I will try to, one day, take a better one.)

By the end of the 19th century, Monet started painting Japanese bridges, then began to focus on the lilies in the water beneath those bridges, and he just never stopped painting those. His wife died, then his son died in WWI, Monet himself began to go blind, and that is all that was taught to me about the last third of the artist's life.

So you look through these [some 250 versions of the Water Lilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Lilies_(Monet_series)) that he painted, and they just feel so underwhelming, compared to his often innovative and sometimes breathtaking previous works. Even looking at one of the most famous works in the series, the massive triptych in the MoMA (1914-26, 200 x 1272 cm), it looks like nothing important. It looks like a big, ugly mess of questionable color choices in a boring composition of a played-out gimmick.

But that is all based on photos. And, as art history professors love to say, "Nothing compares to seeing a work in person." Too bad I forgot this—and that no one said this of the Water Lilies. Let me say that I maintain that the middle and right panels are complete messes! The left panel, though... in person, it is unbelievable. Monet somehow, with a total mess of brushstrokes that barely make sense, captures depth in two different dimensions. The reflections of the clouds on the water, and the green leaves, provide depth in the direction of near to far. The verticality of the brushstrokes in the body of the water, all just blues and greens, creates a sense of depth in the water itself, from the surface downward.

Is the panel still a mess? In photographs, yes. In person, from the wrong angles, yes. But from one particular spot? Completely transformed—it is like looking at actual water. It becomes an immersive sensation of actual water. I could barely tear myself away from that spot.

So yes—for some out there, please talk about more than just the Water Lilies, when we talk about Monet and Impressionism. But for the others, like me before I saw the light: give the Water Lilies a chance.
