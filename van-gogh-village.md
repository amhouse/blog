There is nothing immediately surprising about the Starry Night. You step off the elevator on the top floor of the MoMA, turn a corner, and it's surrounded by a crowd. You see the backs of heads and the sky of Van Gogh's most recognizable work—but you see it only through cameras on phone screens, as people in the crowd move up to the front, take their photos, and walk away. At this point, the Starry Night looks exactly like it does on countless magnets, screensavers, and small prints.

But then the heads clear. You step closer. You reach the front of the crowd. And you notice in the bottom right corner—oh, a village. It's something you have never looked at in reproductions, as it typically renders so small and dark, completely lost against the vibrancy of the sky.

And this village has depth! From the colors, warmer in the front, cooler as it recedes into green and blue hills; from the brush strokes, beautifully curved and rolling into the distance; and from the physical depth of the layers of paint itself, visibly thicker as the village comes off the canvas and toward you. In person, the village is bright and beautiful, the paint glistening under the light, and the colors rich and vibrant. In person, the village steals the show.

The rest of the painting? It's fine. The sky, of course. It's swirling and pleasing as it always is. (The brush strokes, I have to admit, are impressive; in person, they are entrancing to trace around, with the eye wrapping around light, into dark, and back around light, perpetually.) But it's a known quantity. We talk about the sky all the time, as we do with the artist himself.

Oh, Van Gogh was troubled; he ate yellow paint; he depicted uncertainty and claustrophobia and melancholy; he made disturbing landscapes with lines that led to nowhere. Yes, that's all fine and good, but the folklore of Van Gogh precedes him and his artwork. Everything I learned from art historians simply fed into what popular culture already knows about him. This leads too easily into the trap of interpretation before looking—seeing only what feeds into the established narrative, and not truly seeing what is really in front of you.

So I wish people would talk more about the villages. The unpretentious, overlooked, and simply magnificent parts of works we think we have seen before.
